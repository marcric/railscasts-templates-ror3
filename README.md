# Railscasts Projects Templates

## Introduction

### I'm a big fan of Ryan Bates' work

I follow Railscasts episodes as much as I can, and some times go back to the past trying
a "remix" - doing the same exercises using a fresh technology - like Rails 3 for instance.

So, following Ryan's path and giving back to open source...

This is an effort to get all of the projects templates being updated to Rails 3

I will try to create a timeline relating episodes and it's projects (it's already done up to episode #100)

The original work comes from here:

_[railscasts-episodes/templates][rcet]_

That is it. _**[MarcRic][mr]**_

## Strategy

### The projects:

**There are 6 projects used in Railscasts up to now:**

1. todo (Since Episode 1) [stage1][tdst1] &#10004; - [stage2][tdst2] - &#10004; - stage3 &#10008;

2. store (Since Episode 17) stage1 &#10008; - stage2 - &#10008; - stage3 &#10008;

3. railscasts (Since Episode 18) - (to be verified)

4. blog (Since Episode 70)  stage1 &#10008; - stage2 - &#10008; - stage3 &#10008;

5. forum (Since Episode ?) stage1 &#10008; - stage2 - &#10008; - stage3 &#10008;

6. wiki (Since Episode ?) stage1 &#10008; - stage2 - &#10008; - stage3 &#10008;

* There are specific or non project related episodes:
  * [Here they are][snep].

### What will be done (my first wishes)

**For each of the 5 first projects we will provide three entries (stages)**

* **Stage1** - Just the scaffold with basic relationship in Models and a starting page in routes.rb
* **Stage2** - An intermediate one with seeds to populate the database
* **Stage3** - The current stage of that project up to the last appearance in **[Railscasts][rc]**
