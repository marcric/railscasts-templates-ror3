# Railscasts Projects Templates

## Introduction

### I'm a big fan of Ryan Bates' work

I follow Railscasts episodes as much as I can, and some times go back to the past trying
a "remix" - doing the same exercises with a more recent technology - like Rails 3 for instance.

So, following Ryan's instruction and giving back to open source...

This is an effort to get all of the projects templates being updated to Rails 3

The original work comes from here:

_[railscasts-episodes/templates][rcet]_

That is it. _**[MarcRic][mr]**_

## Strategy

### The projects:

**There are 6 projects used in Railscasts up to now:**

* blog
* forum
* store
* todo
* wiki
* railscasts (Railscasts site project)

### What will be done (my first wishes)

**For each of the 5 first projects we will provide three entries (stages)**

* **Stage1** - Just the scaffold with basic relationship in Models and a starting page in routes.rb
* **Stage2** - An intermediate one with seeds to populate the database
* **Stage3** - The current stage of that project up to the last appearance in **[Railscasts][rc]**
