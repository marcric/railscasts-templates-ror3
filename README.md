# Railscasts Projects Templates

### I'm a big fan of Rayan Bates's work

I follow Railscasts episodes as much as I can, and some times go back to the past
trying a "remix" making the same with a more recent technology like Rails 3 for instance.

So, following Ryan's instruction and gibing back to open source, this is an effort
to get all of the projects templates being updated to Rails 3.0.3

The original work comes from here:

_[railscasts-episodes/templates][rcet]_

That is it.
