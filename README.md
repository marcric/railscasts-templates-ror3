# Railscasts Projects Templates

### I'm a big fan of Ryan Bates' work

I follow Railscasts episodes as much as I can, and some times go back to the past trying a "remix".

Making the same episode with a more recent technology like Rails 3 for instance.

So, following Ryan's instruction and giving back to open source...

This is an effort to get all of the projects templates being updated to Rails 3.0.3

The original work comes from here:

_[railscasts-episodes/templates][rcet]_

That is it.
